//! Witnesses for the whole-schema import-unification slice: a loaded schema is
//! one WHOLE, so a declaration that arrives through an import is a declaration
//! like any other — a minted identifier with a name-table row, its frame body
//! decomposed into identifier-carrying structure.
//!
//! Three properties are proven, all over the shared reaction frame fixture
//! (`Work` / `Action`) that a consumer imports and applies at its root
//! positions:
//!
//! - (a) a dependency's declarations mint IDENTICAL identifiers whether the
//!   dependency is lowered standalone or arrives via import resolution into a
//!   consumer's loaded whole — deterministic minting gives this for free;
//! - (b) projection equivalence and reload-against-prior stay green over the
//!   import-bearing fixture; and
//! - (c) the substrate canonical bytes are insensitive to a rename of an
//!   imported declaration performed through the name table — the universal
//!   rename-stability property, now holding over imported declarations too.

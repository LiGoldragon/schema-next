//! Minted nominal identifiers and their name table — the stringless
//! identity substrate the target `CoreSchema` is built on.
//!
//! Every declaration — type, field, variant, and generic — is addressed by a
//! [`NominalIdentifier`], a minted 128-bit value that stays fixed across all
//! edits including rename. The human names live apart in a [`NameTable`] mapping
//! identifier to current name, so structure and names move independently. See
//! the "Core and True schema" section of `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
//!
//! # PROVISIONAL — this minting mechanism is possibly unreliable
//!
//! The minting scheme here is the provisional one sanctioned by the OPEN
//! section "deterministic identifier and NameTable creation" of
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md`. It is NOT a solution to that open problem, and nothing in
//! this module should be read as claiming otherwise.
//!
//! What works: minting is a deterministic hash, order-independent by
//! construction — the same declarations in any source order yield identical
//! identifiers and, after canonical sorting, identical `NameTable` bytes. A
//! top-level declaration mints from `(kind, name at introduction)`. A MEMBER —
//! a struct field, an enum variant, or a generic parameter binder — mints from
//! `(kind, owner identifier digest, member local name)` through
//! [`NominalIdentifier::mint_member`]: it is anchored to its OWNER's identifier,
//! never the owner's current name, so renaming the owner leaves every member
//! identifier fixed by construction. On load, a declaration whose kind, owner
//! scope, and current name are already in a prior `NameTable` reuses that
//! identifier; a miss mints fresh. A rename through the table keeps the
//! identifier and only updates the row's name, and a member row carries the
//! owner as a stable identifier plus the member's local name, so an owner rename
//! never leaves a member row carrying a stale owner prefix.
//!
//! What is unsolved, and why this is possibly unreliable:
//!
//! - Selecting which persisted `NameTable` applies to a source being loaded is
//!   itself a lineage question, and lineage is answered by the core hash, which
//!   cannot be computed until identifiers are assigned. That bootstrap
//!   circularity is not resolved here.
//! - An out-of-band rename — editing a name directly in `.schema` source rather
//!   than through [`NameTable::rename`] — is still indistinguishable from a
//!   delete-plus-add: the old current name is gone from the table, so
//!   re-association misses and mints a FRESH identifier, breaking lineage. For a
//!   top-level owner this cascades, because its members are anchored to the
//!   owner identifier that just moved.
//!
//! Both hazards stay OPEN in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. The real answer may only emerge
//! after the system is implemented and used; until then this substrate must be
//! treated as possibly unreliable. This provisional minting IS the current
//! lineage foundation: the core hash rests entirely on the identifier-built
//! canonical bytes, so every hazard above is inherited by lineage identity as it
//! stands today — it is not a dormant mechanism awaiting a later wiring into the
//! hashing domains.

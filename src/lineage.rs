//! The in-crate lineage graph: the receipt edges that connect schema versions
//! by their core hashes. See the "Hashing and lineage" part of the "Core and
//! True schema" section of `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
//!
//! Each accepted edit produces a [`SchemaEditReceipt`] keyed by its (parent core
//! hash -> child core hash) pair. A structural edit moves the core hash, so its
//! edge advances the graph; a rename leaves the core hash fixed, so its edge is
//! a self-loop that records a `NameTable` delta on the chain without advancing
//! it. Two questions the version-control layer asks are pure walks over these
//! stored edges:
//!
//! - the historical-to-current CONVERSION CHAIN between two versions is the
//!   composition of the receipts along the path from the older core hash to the
//!   newer one, so a value two versions old is carried to current by applying
//!   each edge's migration in order; and
//! - COMMON-ANCESTOR search between two core hashes is a backward walk to the
//!   nearest core hash from which both descend.
//!
//! This is the typed representation the schema daemon will later persist; the
//! graph invents no storage of its own.
